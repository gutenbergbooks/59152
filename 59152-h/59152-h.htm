<p>Under this heading I find an article
from Mr. W. M. Hoge, who says that
he has invented a way of preparing
liquid honey so that it will not congeal.
He adds that this discovery will be beneficial
to bee-keepers, and he explains
how we will profit by it. The tendency
of honey to candy, for all the adulterators
of honey, has proved to be a great
impediment; while, for the producers,
it is a good characteristic, for it is the
best stamp that a bee-keeper can put on
his product&mdash;a stamp that the adulterators
are unable to counterfeit.</p>

<p>Now that the consumers at large begin
to give their preference to candied
honey, the adulterators, seeing their
sales decreasing, try to invent some
means to stop this result, and incite us
to help them to continue their fraudulent
practice.</p>

<p>Let us remember that the candying
of honey is the best test of purity thus
far; that, by preventing honey from
candying, we lower it to the level of
glucosed honey; and that, as long as
liquid honey can be found on our markets,
we will be compelled to compete
with adulterated honey, for the profit of
this adulteration will always tempt the
unscrupulous dealers, while we will be
unable to compete with them for the
price.</p>

<p>A few years ago we could find liquid
honey, in glass jars, in every good grocery.
Three years ago I produced, at
the Western Illinois and Eastern Iowa
Convention, held at Burlington, Iowa,
one of these bottles, bought in St. Louis,
labeled “Pure Extracted Honey, from
John Long, New York.” Mr. Hoge,
who resided in New York at that time,
probably knows “John Long.” This
“pure honey” was analyzed by an
expert chemist and found mostly glucose.
These jars and tumblers are now
of slow sale, for the consumers begin to
have confidence in candied honey. We
are, therefore, in a fair way for selling
our product. Let us go on, and turn
the cold shoulder to the advice of those
who have, so far, caused more prejudice
than profit to bee-keepers.</p>

<p>Mr. Hoge, who has visited the old
continent, knows, as well as I do, that
in Europe liquid honey is unsalable, for
the consumers are accustomed to buying
candied honey. Let us persist in
our efforts to educate the people on this
question, and we will drive all spurious
honey from our markets.</p>

<p class="center">REV. W. BALLENTINE, A. M.</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<p>I see in the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>, under the
above caption, a question from Mr. H.
G. Colwell, of Columbus, Ohio, relative
to the effects of honey eaten by the
Grecian troops, under Xenophon, as
they passed through Colchia in their famous
retreat homeward. In regard to
this, you propose a query, “Why did
the ancient Colchian honey cause the
above disorder?” I have frequently
had my attention turned to this subject
in reading Xenophon's Anabasis in the
original, from which the extract by Mr.
Colwell is taken. From the best
sources of information at my command,
the following seems to be the most rational.</p>

<p>The honey of Asia Minor in many localities
appears to be gathered from the
flowers of the order Apocynoceæ, or
dog's-bane. Of this order, Prof. Wilson,
in his botany, page 588, observes:
“These plants possess active, and often
suspicious qualities, residing in the
white juice with which the order is pervaded,
and in the seeds, which are often
deadly poisons. The alkaloid <em>strychnine</em>,
or <em>strychinea</em>, one of the most violent
poisons, is the active principle of the
Strychorea Nux-vomica, of India. It
is sometimes administered as a medicine,
but with doubtful success; a single
seed of one species is sufficient to
kill 20 persons. The order is generally
emetic.”</p>

<p>In corroboration of this, I will give
you the opinion of the celebrated Ainsworth,
who traveled over the route of
the Grecians, and took notes of all the
localities and incidents recorded by
Xenophon. He observes that “this fact
of the honey of Asia Minor being, in
certain places, and at certain seasons, of
a poisonous nature, was known to all
antiquity, and is very common at the
present day, so much so, that I have
known the peasants to inquire if we
would prefer the bitter or the sweet
honey, for the honey so qualified has a
slight, but not unpleasant, bitterness,
and is preferred by many, from producing,
when taken in moderate quantities,
the effect of slight intoxication.
Pliny notices two kinds of honey, one
found at Heraclea, in Pontus, and another
among the Sanni or Mocrones.
The first he supposed to be produced by
a plant called Ægolethron, or goatsbane;
the second by a species of rhododendron.
Dioscorides, Diodorus, Siculus
and Aristotle, all notice the honey of
Heraclea Pontica. The celebrated
botanist, Tournefort, ascertained on the
spot, that the honey of bees feeding on
the Azalea Pontica, as also on the
Rhododendron Ponticum, possessed
mischievous properties; but as the bitter
and intoxicating honey is found in
many parts of Asia Minor, where these
plants do not flower, it is extremely
probable that these peculiar properties
are further derived from the flower of
the Nerium Oleander, or common rose-laurel,
the leaves of which are known
to be acrid and poisonous. The natural
family to which the rose-laurel belongs
(Apocynaceæ) is distinguished by plants
endued with dangerous and fatal properties,
and these act on the nerves so
as to produce stupefaction. Rhodoraceæ
also possesses narcotic properties,
but in a less marked degree.”</p>

<p>It appears from this, that the honey
gathered by the bees from these poisonous
plants, possessed some of the inherent
qualities of the plants themselves,
and operated like a narcotic or
opiate on the nerves, producing stupefaction
and intoxication. If you see
proper you can give the above a place
in the Weekly, with which I am, so far,
very well pleased.</p>

<p>The engraving shows a perspective
view of a combined winter and summer
stand, which I put up to accommodate
12 hives of the standard Langstroth
pattern. It is constructed as follows:
Put in the ground 9 oak posts 4 × 4 inches,
for a frame to nail the 14 foot boards to&mdash;3
posts on each side, and 3 between
these, set in the ground 18 inches. The
ends are 9 feet wide, which I find gives
ample room to manipulate the bees between
the rows of hives, the operator
being in the shade, and not in front of
the entrance of the bees, which seldom
bother me. The sides front east and
west. The ends are open during the
summer, and the north end boarded up
in winter. We use millet hay for protection,
filling in spaces between the
hives, and over and under them, almost
filling up between the rows, clearing
away enough in front of the entrance
for the bees to take a flight when the
weather permits.</p>

<p>This protection keeps them quiet, and
storms beat on the shelter and on the
millet hay. Of course, this is not a
water-proof shelter or cover, and I do
not think one is needed. It is advantageous
to have an opening in the apex
of the roof; this plan of having one
roof higher than the other secures it
with the least expense. It is curious to
notice how the bees fly out of these
spaces marked A, A (as both ends are
open) while the operators manipulating
the hives. Sixteen boards 14 feet long
and 1 foot wide cover it, and with the 9
posts and 4 2 × 4 studding to set the hives
on, and short pieces to set on top of the
posts to nail the roof to, complete the
lumber bill.</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<p class="center">H. L. JEFFREY.</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<p>You ask for my observations on foul
brood regarding the cases noted in the
<span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>. There are many who,
I know, will disagree with me, but nevertheless,
it seemed to come from no
other source. The largest case of it was
25 colonies in one apiary. Ever since
the year 1873 they had been wintered in
the cellar, in a sort of room fitted up
especially for them. They were usually
put in about Nov. 25, and taken out
about April 1st to the 20th, according to
the season. This receptacle was directly
under the living room, which was kept
very warm. The bee-room was generally
quite dry, and towards spring would
stand from 45° to 50°, which would let
the bees have from 60° to 80° in the
hive, or perhaps 90°, causing the cluster
to spread, and there was always a good
supply of brood in the combs when taken
from the cellar, and generally a considerable
number of young hatched bees.
So far everything was as good as could
be asked for, and every good bee-keeper
will say this could not have anything to
do with foul brood; perhaps not.</p>

<p>These same hives, with more space
and more surface of comb than a 10
frame Langstroth hive gives, were put
into the cellar with all their combs in
place, with a box 6 inches deep below
the hive, and another above filled with
straw, or with a top story filled with
rags, old clothes and pieces of carpet or
straw. The full complement of combs
was left in the hives, regardless of the
strength of the colonies, and they were
then set on their summer stands without
using division boards, or any contraction
of combs. After setting out
they were generally fed liberally every
night to induce breeding, which is a
good plan if properly handled, but in
this case it helped to breed the disease,
and it did do it to the fullest extent.
Why? First, a small colony should not
be given any more combs than it can
cover, either in summer or winter. If
the hive is too large, insert a division on
one or both sides; if on both sides, let
one of them be at least half an inch
shallower than the hive, then if the numbers
increase, they can crowd outside
of it.</p>

<p>Second, if they are wintered indoors,
in a hive full of combs, take away all
you can before they are set out in the
spring, even if you have to feed to prevent
starvation.</p>

<p>Third, if you do winter indoors on a
full set of combs, do not commence
feeding regularly, to induce breeding, as
soon as set out, though it be the 25th of
April or even the 1st of May.</p>

<p>In the case mentioned the consequences
were: In the weak colonies
some of the bees died in the combs and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>

contracted some moisture, consequently
would mold. Some strong colonies
would do the same, but many of the
dead bees would be thrown down. The
cellar had a drain 100 feet long, with a
fall of 5 feet, to keep the cellar dry, and
a ventilator 3 feet above the house-sill
outside, at the south. The ventilator
opened on warm days, consequently a
draft of warm air, fire in the room
above, temperature in the bee-cellar
raised, cluster of bees spread, queen
goes to laying, honey consumed, brood
reared and old bees wearing out; all of
these conditions are the requisites of
good, strong, healthy colonies, and they
are just as surely the forerunners of
first-class cases of foul brood every time.</p>

<p>I know that 99 out of every 100 bee-keepers
will differ with me, but go
through the colonies with me 10 or 15
days after setting out on the summer
stands; suppose in that time we have
had 2 or 3 good flying days; the feeding
induced the queen to lay more rapidly
and forced the cluster to spread; the
eggs hatched into larvæ; on the pleasant
days the old bees flew out but forgot
to fly in again, thus diminishing the
cluster; then there came 2 or 3 stormy
days in succession, cold and chilling;
the cluster contracted as well as diminished
in numbers; the minute larvæ
starved and dead, and some, perhaps,
that are advanced to capping; another
flying day, and their numbers are more
reduced. The dead bees in the combs
putrefy, and you have for your pains a
first-class case of foul brood in the near
future. Many will shake their heads,
but I saw the colonies, and in 3 years I
saw the 25 and their increase decreased
to 17, the 17 and their increase decreased
to 9, the 9 down to 2, and the 2 went, in
the spring of 1880, “where the woodbine
twineth.”</p>

<p>I can probably give, better than any
one living, the history of the first efforts
made to introduce Italian bees into this
country; as I knew well the late Messrs.
Samuel Wagner and Richard Colvin,
and Messrs. S. B. Parsons and P. G.
Mahan, who, with myself, were the first
to import them. Messrs. Wagner and
Edward Jessop, both residents of
York, Penn., received from Dzierzon,
in 1856, a colony of Italian bees which
had starved on shipboard. Mr. Wagner's
letter to me, August, 1856, and
given the next spring, in my 2nd edition
on bees, is the earliest notice, published
in this country, of the Italian
race of bees. Messrs. Wagner and
Colvin, subsequently, bought a few
queens of Dzierzon, which were consigned
to the care of the surgeon of a
Bremen steamship, who had been carefully
taught what precautions to use
for their safety. Fearing that the bees
might sting his passengers, the captain
would not allow them to be put on his
vessel.</p>

<p>“In the winter of 1858-59,” (I quote
from Mr. Colvin's able article on beekings,
in the Report of the Commissioner
of Agriculture for 1863, page
530,) “another attempt was made by
Mr. Wagner, Rev. L. L. Langstroth,
and myself. The order was placed in
the hands of the surgeon of the steamer,
to whose charge the bees were to have
been committed, but in consequence of
his determining to leave the ship, the
effort failed.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Subsequently arrangements
were made, in the latter part of
that year, and we received 7 living
queens. Only two or three young queens
were reared by us during that fall and
winter, and in the following spring we
found that all our imported stock had
perished. In conjunction with Mr.
Wagner, I determined to make another
trial; the queens, however, did not arrive
until June, 1860.”</p>

Mr. Colvin, having formed the acquaintance
of the German Captain, not only convinced
him that the bees could not escape
to injure anyone, but inspired him with a
strong desire to be the first to bring over in
his own vessel, this valuable race of bees.

<p>Our queens, which came in 1859, were
in charge of a German resident of
Brooklyn, N. Y., who was returning
home from a visit to his friends, and to
whom Mr. Wagner had given very careful
directions how to care for them.
This person, learning that Mr. Mahan
had expressed the intention of having
the honor of landing, in America, the
first living Italian bees, and desiring, as
he told me, to secure this honor for us,
communicated Mr. Mahan's intention
to the captain, who, as soon as the
gang-way was in place, was the first
person to step ashore, proclaiming with
a very loud voice: “These are the first
Italian bees ever landed on the shores
of America!”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1856, Mr. S. B. Parsons,
of Flushing, L. I., invited me to
visit him, and advise with him as to
the best way of managing his Italian
bees. On my way, I called upon Mr.
Mahan, who was joint owner with me
of a large interest in my patent hive.
He gave me a very graphic account of
his visit to the apiary of the Baron Von
Berlepsch, from whom he obtained a
queen, and supplied me with a few Italian
workers for Prof. Joseph Lidy, that
he might determine how the length of
proboscis, in that variety, compared
with that of the black bee. On arriving
at Flushing, Mr. Parsons showed
me five hollow logs, or “gums,” placed
in an old bee-shed. It was a warm, sun-shiny
day, and I saw only an occasional
bee flying out from one of the hives.
These colonies had been purchased in
Italy, carried safely on the backs of
mules over the Alpine passes, to Genoa,
from which port they were safely
shipped to New York; but by a succession
of mishaps, four of them died at
Flushing. The fifth contained a mere
handful of bees, with their queen,
which I introduced to a colony of black
bees. It is hardly necessary to say that
none of these hives were ever in the
same vessel with Mr. Mahan.</p>

<p>On the 18th of April, the steamer
Argo arrived in New York, after a tedious
and stormy voyage. Mr. Herman,
a German bee-keeper, and author of a
work on the Italian bee, who had been
furnished with a large sum of money by
Mr. Parsons to buy Italian bees in the
best districts of Italy, and who had
agreed to bring them over in the original
hives, and breed queens for Mr.
Parsons, <em>was not on board</em>, but in his
place, a young Austrian, by the name
of Bodmer. On the 19th, as soon as the
bees were allowed to be landed, they
were carried to Flushing. The small
boxes in which they were put up were
in three different packages, one of
which was consigned to the U. S. Government,
one to Mr. Mahan, and one to
Mr. Parsons. As the Austrian said
that he knew, by examination on shipboard,
that the bees were in a very bad
condition, and many of them already
dead, and, as the day was very pleasant,
they were all examined under my personal
supervision, and I can assure Mr.
Robinson that every colony consigned
to the Government and Mr. Mahan, was
dead. A few, only, of those marked
for Mr. Parsons, had living queens,
some of which soon died, and in a short
time he found himself the possessor of
only two queens, one of which was the
queen found alive upon my arrival at
Flushing.</p>

<p>By my advice, Mr. Wm. W. Cary, of
Coleraine, Mass., a very skillful bee-keeper,
and a thoroughly trustworthy
man, was sent for by Mr. Parsons. One
of the queens was entrusted to his care,
on the premises of Mr. Parsons, and
the other to Mr. Bodmer, some distance
off, who did not raise queens enough
even to pay for the black bees and honey
which were purchased for his use; while
Mr. Cary Italianized a large apiary for
Mr. Parsons, besides filling all his orders
for queens.</p>

<p>One hundred and eleven queens were
carried to California, by Mr. A. J. Biglow,
108 of which reached there in good
condition. This small per cent. of loss
was, in part, owing to the skillful supervision
of Mr. Biglow, and to the purifying
flight which, by my advice, he
gave them on the Isthmus of Panama;
but all his precautions would have been
of no avail but for the judicious way in
which they were prepared by Mr. Cary
and himself, for so long a voyage. The
bees sent to Mr. Parsons were in cigar
boxes, into which the combs were
merely crowded or wedged: the loosening
of the combs on so rough a voyage
killed some of the queens, while others
were drowned, with their bees, in honey;
and others, still, starved from the boxes
being over-crowded with bees. It is
hardly necessary to contrast Mr. Biglow's
success with the heavy losses sustained
for years by those who imported
bees from Europe. The result of Mr.
Parsons' dealings with Herman were,
that for $1,200 advanced to him, he had
only 2 queens to show. The next season
Mr. Bodmer, having learned how to
pack bees for a sea voyage, brought
over a number of queens in good condition,
for Mr. E. W. Rose, but was very
unfortunate in the management of
them. Herman came, some years after,
to this country, and was employed by a
friend of mine in Philadelphia, to purchase
for him, in Italy, a large number
of queens. The return voyage was long
and stormy, and every queen died on
board the steamer.</p>

<p>As a sample of what may be done in
many parts of the country to diffuse
knowledge regarding apiculture, and
awaken an interest in bee-keeping as a
business, let me give a brief account of
a meeting recently held in Shaftesbury
Hall, Toronto, under the auspices of
the Y. M. C. A. Mr. D. A. Jones, having
made the acquaintance of some of the
leading spirits in the organization just
named, offered to give a free lecture on
bee-keeping. The offer was accepted,
and a meeting announced to which the
members of the Y. M. C. A. were admitted
<i lang="la">gratis</i>, while the general public
were charged a small fee. Mr. Jones
invited the writer to be present as a reserve
force, in case he should break
down, (!) and what enthusiastic bee-keeper
would not rally to the rescue
when thus appealed to? Unfortunately
Mr. J. was not in good trim, having
been sick enough to keep his bed most
of the day preceding the lecture evening.
However, he gathered himself up
for the task he had undertaken, and
was cheered by the appearance of his
ally just as the lecture was about to begin.
For a sick man, he did bravely,
and spoke for nearly an hour. His remarks
were, of course, general, and
very different from what they would
have been if his audience had been composed
of experienced apiarists. He
discoursed on bee-keeping as a business,
explained the outlines of it, showed
that it was profitable, and especially
dwelt upon the gain which would accrue
to the country if it were more generally
engaged in. An interesting sketch of
his journey to Cyprus and the Holy
Land formed the latter part of his address.
The writer supplemented his
remarks by a talk of about half an hour,
the chief theme of which was advice to
intending bee-keepers. There was a
far larger audience than might have
been expected, considering the prevalent
apathy in regard to apicultural pursuits,
and considering also that the
weather was unpleasantly stormy.
Much interest was evidently awakened;
a number of questions were asked at
the close of the addresses, and many
lingered when “meetin' was out” to
talk about bee-matters. An immense
amount of good might be done if practical
bee-keepers would engage in this
kind of missionary work. The public
is a dull scholar, and needs to be “enthused”
by men who have the true apicultural
spirit. Among other questions,
these were asked:&mdash;“What is the best
bee journal?” and “What is the best
book on bee-keeping?” The <span class="smcap">American
Bee Journal</span>, and Cook's “Manual,”
were the replies given. In his
counsels to beginners, the writer insisted
very strongly, that the first step
in practical bee-keeping was to get a
good hand-book, and journal of apiculture.
So, if you receive orders from
Toronto for the <span class="smcap">American Bee Journal</span>,
and “Manual,” you may give
Jones' meeting the credit for having
inspired them. There are not only Y.
M. C. As., but other organizations all
over the land that would be glad to have
a meeting in the interests of bee-keeping.
If 2 or 3 practical bee-keepers
would divide the work and responsibility
of maintaining such a meeting, it
would not be so formidable, as though
only one man undertook it. A plain,
common-sense talk on a subject of such
practical and commercial importance as
bee-keeping, would be a welcome change
from the elaborate lectures usually delivered
before Y. M. C. As., Lyceums,
and bodies of that ilk. I hope Jones'
enthusiastic zeal will stir others up to
emulation and imitation. Reader, if
conscious of possessing “the gift of
the gab” in any degree, “go thou and
do likewise.”</p>

<p>A prominent wine-grower in this
country, told me, about a year ago, that
he did not want bees in his neighborhood
as he found they injured his
grape crop. As I have a small grapery,
of about a hundred plants, between the
rows of which I find shelter for about
20 colonies of bees, I determined to observe
if his theory was correct, for I
was loth to give up either. If any fruit
crop could be injured by the visit of
bees, mine is surely the one. The result
of one season's close observation
has convinced me: 1st. That bees promote
rather than injure the foundations
of fruit buds, because the bunches
on my vines were full, with better developed
berries, than those produced on
vines less exposed to their visits, and
my peach and cherry trees were as
fairly loaded with fruit as they well
could be. 2nd. That in the fall bees
only visit our ripe berries, that have
been sweetened by early frosts, and are
very rarely seen on good sound fruit,
when the skin is unbroken, and that
the loss from this cause is of very little
consequence, as the fruit attacked would
fall off itself, without the visit of the
bees, before gathering. I am wintering
21 colonies, mostly Italians; procured
one of Jones' Cyprian queens, but
too late in the fall to speak intelligently
of the result. They are on summer
stands, well sheltered and surrounded
with straw, having means of exit, and
I think are wintering well, but they
have not had a good fly since early in
November.</p>

<p>One of my Cyprian queens has upset
an established doctrine in bee-science,
set at naught all the bee-books, and reversed
the old adage which says: “hope
long deferred maketh the heart sick.”
In the latter part of last season I reared
some Cyprian queens from eggs and
larvæ, obtained from Mr. Root; they
were 7 in number, and were hatched on
the 6th, 7th, and 8th days of Sept. The
weather being warm and fair they were
all fertilized (except one, which never
returned from her bridal tour) by the
12th of the month, and a few days later
they were all laying except one; that
being the finest, brightest-looking queen
of the lot, stubbornly refused to commence
the duties of a good queen. She
was in a strong nucleus which was fed
regularly and bountifully, till the hive
looked as though the occupants were
enjoying a bountiful white clover harvest,
but “nary an egg would she lay.”</p>

<p>She was provided with a clean empty
comb, placed in the center of the colony,
and the feeding kept up till winter
set in, but no brood appeared. The
hive was not opened from the time it
was prepared for winter (say Nov. 15)
till the middle of Dec., at which time
there was not a sign of brood. Then
came the long siege of snow and bitter
winds which lasted till the 30th of Jan.;
on that date our bees enjoyed a good,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>

cleansing flight, and I remembered my
non-laying queen and proceeded to look
her combs over, and to my surprise, on
one of the center combs I found a little
patch of brood about half as large as a
postal card, some of which was sealed
over. It was genuine worker brood,
and no mistake. Since which time she
has been laying nicely, and now has a
nice lot of brood for the time of year.</p>

<p>My bees, 30 colonies with selected
queens, have come safely through the
winter to the 1st of March, and there is
really but little danger of losing bees
in this climate after the 1st of this
month, unless they are short of stores
and shamefully neglected. The bee-man
is aware, above all others, that
there is “many a slip betwixt the cup
and the lip,” however closely he may
watch his business. On the 30th of Jan.
last, when my bees were flying lively, I
noticed that one large colony with a
tested Cyprian queen, were not stirring
like the others. I proceeded to open
the hive and found the bees so nearly
starved that they could only show signs
of life by a feeble motion of their wings,
which produced no sound whatever.
Not a bee seemed able to change its position;
the fore-runner of death was
already present in the form of a cold,
damp atmosphere in the brood chamber.
I prepared some rich sweetened water,
separated the frames gently, and sprinkled
the bees thoroughly with the
sweetened water, and poured some of it
into the empty cells. The frames were
then readjusted and a dry woolen quilt
spread over the bees and the sun permitted
to shine into the hive. In about
an hour I raised the quilt and the inmates
of the hive were stirring briskly,
handing around the good cheer, while
some of them showed fight in a most
patriotic style. They were provided
with stores, and are now a No. 1 colony.
So much for bee-science.</p>

<p>What a lesson this teaches! Here was
a large colony of bees perishing with
famine, as one single individual; so unselfishly
had they divided their family
stores amongst themselves that when
relief did come, though not till their
dire extremity, there was no practical
loss of life. Before I close I cannot resist
the temptation to tell how my bees
have been carrying in meal, and prancing
gaily on the alighting boards with
their white pellets exposed to the best
advantage.</p>

<p>No doubt but by this time many of
the Eastern bee-keepers are looking
to this far-off “land of milk and honey,”
as of late years it has been called. Perhaps
the reason is partly because here
abundant warm rains have fallen all
over the State, and the world-renowned
honey region has received its complement
of the down-pour; in fact, the inhabitants
hardly ever saw so much rain
visit that section at the right time.</p>

<p>There are now signs, however, that
indicate the sun will shine with its usual
brightness; that those delightful spring
days, which are so peculiar to this fair
land, are about to favor us. Let this be
the case and the bees will soon be flying
out by thousands, and the willow blossoms
will each and all receive a welcome
visit from those industrious insects.
Their journeyings will not be confined
to the banks of the creeks where the
willows grow, but the woodland, where
the Australian blue-gum (<i lang="la">Eucalyptus
globulus</i>) has been planted by the hand
of man, and which holds out its bounteous
chalice for the busy bee to come
and sip of nectar deep and sweet.</p>

<p>While the loss in bees will in all probability
be great in the States east of the
Rocky Mountains, here the loss, if any,
will not be quite as bad as it has been
other years. Thus it will be seen that
our eastern brethren will have to commence
the season with greatly reduced
forces, while the apiarists in this State
will commence operations with more
colonies, and, consequently, with more
bees. Last season was a good one, and
the bees went into winter quarters with
abundant stores, which have carried
them through the mild winter safely.
The bee flora having had ample rains
to insure a most thrifty growth, will
bloom for a longer period than it has
heretofore, and, of course, will insure
an enormous yield of honey.</p>

<p>On account of the long continuance
of the rain, but few flowers have commenced
to bloom. Still the plants are
growing, and when they do commence,
they will be able to do so in a vigorous
manner. A few of those now blooming
are the willows in variety, <i lang="la">Eucalyptus
globulus</i>, and it is unusually covered
with flowers; wild currant, a pretty fair
honey plant, but scarce; wild gooseberry;
wild blackberry, just beginning;
raspberry, ditto; almond; pear and
peach; mignonette; horehound, and a
few others. All of which give the bees
more than they can do to gather the
nectar and pollen.</p>

<p>The present may be called “trying
times” to bee-keepers of America. Poor
honey seasons, hard winters, and the
nefarious warfare against the honey
producers of this country in the vile
adulteration of honey, is indeed trying,
discouraging and diabolical. It appears,
by the papers, that these glucose
scoundrels are not satisfied with adulterating
extracted honey, but according
to this article that I clip from one
of our papers, <cite>The Bushnell Record</cite>, they
are manufacturing comb honey. It
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many singular discoveries have been made among
manufacturers by the census enumerators in the
course of their investigations. For instance, it has
long been known that dealers are in the habit of
adulterating honey with glucose on the plea of thus
improving its keeping qualities. In Boston, however,
there is a firm doing a large business in making honey
entirely from glucose much in the same way as manufacturers
elsewhere make butter from suine and
oleo-margarine. The comb is molded out of paraffine
in excellent imitation of the work of bees; then
the cells are filled with clear glucose and sealed by
passing a hot iron over them, and the product is sent
to Europe as our best honey. The busiest Italian
bees couldn't compete with this firm in turning out
honey, any more than could a Eurotas-like Jersey
breed compete in butter-making with our deft manipulators
of lard and tallow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, brother bee-men, I believe the
time has arrived when this honey counterfeiting
should be stopped; I therefore
suggest that the bee-men of this country
come up in solid phalanx “to the
front,” and with Pres. N. P. Allen and
the bee-paper editors as leaders, let us
agitate the question, educate the people,
stir up the press, wake up the
country, and vote or petition to Congress
until we secure the passage of a
law by Congress against the adulteration
of honey, sugar, syrup, or food of
any kind. Many of the leading journals
of our land are battling for the
right in this matter. The <cite>Burlington</cite>
(Iowa) <cite>Hawkeye</cite> last week expressed
itself as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is time that stringent legislative enactments are
passed, making the adulteration of so many articles
of food a criminal offense, punishable by severe penalties.
If these things must be done to gratify the
inordinate greed of some men, let it be made obligatory
on them that the packages containing spurious
products so proclaim them, under penalty of confiscation
when detected, and the fraud further punishable
by heavy penalty. No man has any right to sell
a compound of honey and glucose as pure honey,
nor has he any right, either moral or legal, to place a
compound of butter and lard, still further “doctored”
with drugs, upon the market as pure butter. If adulterations
of food are allowed to go on in this way,
unrebuked, there is not an article of food known
that will not be counterfeited, and oftentimes with
substances very hurtful in character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am thankful so many are lending
their aid and influence in the cause of
justice and humanity, but we want the
united efforts of honest bee-keepers,
and consumers, and fair dealers, to
make a bold front against every adulterator,
and to expose him to the world.
In this way I believe the problem can
be solved and the evil remedied.</p>

<p>Mr. C. Thielmann, in the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>,
says he has bees which are mostly
hybrids, and he does not know where
they came from, but there are Italians
5 miles from him. Another says he has
no black bees, and his queens must be
purely mated, &amp;c.; another that a neighbor
has had some 10 or 15 colonies so
many years, breeding in-and-in, but
states he manages to keep his number
about the same. Breeding in-and-in
with bees, I am fully convinced, is not
much done. Bees are free rovers and
it seems to be their nature or instinct
to mate at some distance from the
parent hive.</p>

of the speakers at a bee convention in

fowls, in this respect, and that they
could be bred in-and-in until entirely
worthless. This may be done, for
fowls are confined to a particular locality,
but how is it with prairie chickens?
what is the reason they do not degenerate
and run out? Because they are
rovers, like the bee, and are mated by
others from some remote part.</p>

<p>I claim that bees will mix from 5 to 7
miles, and if there are 50 or 100 colonies
within that distance the progeny of a
certain queen will stand a poor show of
mating with drones from its own hive.</p>

<p>To illustrate: While living in N. Y.
I obtained one of Mr. Langstroth's $20
tested Italian queens; I reared some 70
queens and introduced them into as
many colonies. The next season I had
Italian drones by the thousand. My
stock of Italian drones were the only
ones in the locality, so I had a good
chance to test breeding in-and-in. The
next season, and even that fall, there
were hybrid colonies all over the country,
even at the distance of 7 miles, one
man had one colony. One man, 5 miles
from me, wished me to introduce an
Italian queen into one of his colonies.
I think he had 6 and I was surprised to
see 4 of them hybrids, how they came
there he did not know. Others said to
me, “I have your kind of bees, but
where they came from I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>All breeders of Italian queens find it
very difficult to keep their stock up to
the standard of purity. I obtained 5
dollar-queens (Italians) from a breeder
in N. Y., which when tested proved to
be hybrids, showing conclusively that
there were black bees in that section.</p>

<p>My location for surplus honey is not
as good as some other sections of the
State, and from the middle of June to
the last of July, from 4 to 6 weeks, there
appears to be no honey flow, and the
weather being hot and dry, scorches
what bloom is left, soon after June comes
in. Our last rain is in April, or sometimes
late in May, and no more, generally,
before October or November. All
kinds of stock depending on pasture,
especially in the hills, suffer at that
time. When bees can gather no honey,
Italians especially go about visiting for
the purpose of plunder, and woe to the
colony that is not strong enough to defend
its stores. I have reduced the entrance,
covered the entrance with cow-chips,
wet hay, brush, and, in fact, tried
all remedies that ever I saw in print or
heard of, without success. While the
robbers were helping themselves, the
colony robbed was not discouraged, but
appeared to be robbing some other, and
the queen was laying eggs, to be starved
as they advanced to brood; no bees appeared
to be killed at the entrance, as
no blacks were about; they were all
Italians, and they can rob when they
get started.</p>

<p>I exchanged the places of the hives
without success, until I thought of
changing after dark; so while they were
robbing I went to all colonies that appeared
to be quiet and minding their
own business and placed a single stone
on the cover, then on those that were
getting robbed the worst, I placed 2
stones. Then when so dark that no bees
were flying, I exchanged places and
put a strong colony on the stand of a
weak one. Sometimes I had to repeat
this, but not always. Some of those
weak ones filled their hives with golden
rod honey and robbing was stopped for
that season. It was amusing to see the
robbers when those strong colonies had
fairly awakened, to know that they had
callers; they mustered out at the entrance
solid and were ready for business.
The robber seemed to think he
had made a mistake. The strong colony
had not got discouraged; the robbers
could not force the entrance and
the weak colony not in a fighting humor,
received the recruits from the
strong one, which were a little too surprised
at the change to interfere with
the queen and inmates. Most of the
old bees would go to their own stand
but in the confusion of things they
would gradually be at home in their
own hive. I found the plan very successful,
when closing the entrance did
not do. I extracted as late as June 10
to keep down swarming.</p>

<p>Last spring my Italians took the
grafting wax from my peach grafts. I
also observed them gathering the worm
dust from decayed oak wood, and filling
their pockets instead of pollen, about
Christmas. In the valley 2 miles from
here, frost was quite severe, but here
the mercury got below 32° only twice;
the lowest was 28°. Natural bloom was
2 months behind, owing to early frosts
which appeared to drive the sap down
to the roots.</p>

<p>I commenced the year 1875 with 12
box hives and engaged my brother to
hive the colonies in movable frame
hives on shares, but the bees swarmed
faster than he had the hives ready&mdash;one
swarmed 5 times in one week. In the
fall I had 16 colonies in movable frame
and 20 in box hives. I prepared them
for winter by cutting up a light bed-quilt
to cover the frames; drove stakes
about a foot from the hives all around
except in the front, (which faced the
south) and packed straw in the spaces
and filled the cap with chaff and straw,
and covered the hives with straw. In
the spring but one colony was living
and that was in a box hive. The quilts
were laid down flat on the frames, leaving
no ventilation. When it became
cold the bees died and fell on the bottom
board, filling up the spaces between
the frames, the moisture fell on the
bees and froze solid, closing the entrance
so that I could not open it even
with an iron rod. In the corners of
each hive was a chunk of ice, running
half way up the frames. The bees cut
holes through the quilts and when they
could, had crawled into the straw and
died. This was murder, but such was
my experience in 1875-6.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you not recommend some reliable
prophet, who will prophesy good weather
soon? The storm is terrible; not a
road in the county is passable for half a
mile; the drifts are as high as the fences,
and the snow full three feet on the
level.</p>

<p>Bees are getting uneasy, and must
have a flight soon. Many report heavy
losses, even now; others complain that
all are sick with dysentery. In my home
cellar, out of about 275, 4 are slightly
affected, the balance are apparently in
good condition. My outside apiaries
fare worse. Two weeks ago quite a
number had the dysentery slightly; I
should judge about 8 or 10 per cent.
How they now are I cannot tell; certainly,
no better. I believe that they
can stand it a month longer, and my
home apiary 6 weeks, but that is the
limit.</p>

<p>We are all afraid that Vennor's prophecy
of 11 feet of snow will yet be realized,
unless some one can be found to
contradict it. Eleven feet of snow now
would last us until all our bees had died
a natural death from old age. Help us
out of our trouble, if you can.</p>

<p class="sig-left2">Jefferson, Wis., March 3, 1881.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was with much pleasure we noticed,
in last Thursday's Associated Press dispatches,
evidences of Prof. Vennor's
reformation. He undoubtedly has become
convinced that the realization of
the eleven feet of snow attributed to
his prophecies, would not only cause
much suffering and privation with the
majority of humanity, but work serious
and permanent injury to the country
itself. He has relented, or probably
been bribed by Mr. McColm's liberal
offer in the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span> of March 2,
page 69, and now promises us better
weather in the future. His latest prediction
is a reasonably early, warm, dry
spring, cool, pleasant summer, and late,
dry fall, followed by a mild and pleasant
winter. Of course, he promises
abundant crops, and a satisfactory and
remunerative harvest.</p>

<p>But without any further reference to
Prof. Vennor, and without laying any
claim to the “spirit of prophecy,” we
believe the coming season will be a very
satisfactory one to those bee-keepers
who may be prepared to profit by it, and
who have the industry and intelligence
to make the most of it. The winter of
1879-80 was very mild and open, the
scarcity of snow left the earth's surface
exposed alike to the freezing temperature
of night, and the pleasant sunshine
of the balmy days; spring-like showers
were of frequent occurrence, and heavy
rains accompanied with thunder were
so numerous that they ceased to create
surprise; while the weird spring-music
of the frogs was a familiar sound every
month, and nearly every week, throughout
the winter. The alternating cold
and heat “threw out” the roots of the
perennial plants, breaking off the long,
deep-reaching taps and killing the rootlets;
hence the frequent expression,
“but little white clover in bloom, and
no honey in the blossoms.” The honey-producing
annuals have done but little better,
owing, we presume, to the germination
of the seeds in mid-winter, and
the frequent frosting of the tender
sprouts before spring set in. Thus, the
summer and fall bloom was limited, and
no provision having been made to supply
the short-comings of nature, bees
entered upon an unprecedented winter
with a poor supply of good&mdash;or a good
supply of poor&mdash;honey. The many empty
hives in the country this spring is the
result.</p>

<p>The past winter, whatever else may
be said of it, has been propitious for the
honey plants. Cool weather in this latitude
set in during October; vegetation
was checked in the perennials and biennials;
the ground was frozen in November,
and it was overspread with a
mantle of snow quite early in the season,
which has constantly held the roots
of the perennials in position, and prevented
the seeds of the annuals from
unseasonable germination. The stand
of white clover last fall was good, and
mostly of quite recent growth, which
should bloom profusely this season, and
will only need heat and favorable sunshine
to develop the nectar. The causes
enumerated will also tend to confine the
vitality of the linden trees to the roots,
to be drawn out in profuse foliage and
bloom by the genial rays of the summer
sun. The numerous variety of flowers
we believe will gratify the eye of every
lover of the beautiful in nature, and
well reward the labors of the painstaking
bee-keeper. That the price of honey
will be remunerative next fall no one
can doubt, in view of the lessened competition,
owing to the heavy losses the
past winter and the many who will
utilize the bees they have left to refilling
their empty hives.</p>

<p>It would take more space than we can
give a single article, to explain why we
have much confidence in Prof. Vennor's
latest prediction, referred to above&mdash;though
perhaps “the wish is father to
the thought.” We feel confident many
of our readers will cordially unite with
us in welcoming the better time coming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do not the enterprising bee-keepers
of these parts go South with
their bees, and wait till the March
“blizzards” are over? Seems to me the
bees and honey saved would about pay
the expenses of the trip. How much
does a colony need in those parts to winter
on? Would there be any prospect
of obtaining any surplus down there
before the season opens here? These
and a dozen other questions I am vainly
speculating upon. Are Messrs. Bingham
and Perrine the only ones that
have tried the migratory plan? I believe
neither of them was successful;
at any rate, they have abandoned it.
Probably they could not give it the necessary
attention. The loss of larvæ in
shipping seems but trifling compared to
the gain in young bees. Considerable
damage may be done by combs breaking
down, but wired frames would obviate
that difficulty. Is not wired foundation
(wired in frames) the only kind that can
be depended on under all circumstances?
You report in the October number,
1880, page 468, that the Northwestern
Convention disapproved of wired
foundation. There were but few present
that had given wired foundation a
fair trial, and if I am not mistaken,
they were strongly in favor of it.</p>

<p class="sig5"><span class="smcap">H. W. Funk.</span></p>

<p class="sig-left2">Bloomington, Ill., March 5, 1881.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first question is difficult to answer,
as enterprising bee-keepers, like
the balance of humanity, are generally
governed by motives of convenience
or profit. There are very few but have
other business connected with bee-keeping,
and this would suffer if close attention
was given the migratory system.
The amount of honey required to winter
in the South is much less than in the
North, but the quantity is governed by
contingencies, as would be the question,
How much honey will a colony obtain
in the South in a season? Usually bees
obtain considerable surplus in April and
May, in some localities. Mr. Bingham,
we believe, abandoned the migratory
system on account of excessive freights,
while Mr. Perrine met with a series of
disasters from the first which would
have discouraged any one. Mr. W. O.
Abbott was engaged last season with a
floating apiary on the Mississippi river,
from which large returns were anticipated;
but as nothing definite has been
made public since the close of the season,
we suppose it was not a success.
Others have tried Southern wintering,
but we have no data upon which to base
conclusions, except the fact of its abandonment.
The trouble has not been
so much from destruction of combs, as
the expense attending the removal.</p>

<p>A private letter from a gentleman
with several hundred colonies of bees,
located a short distance below Memphis,
Tenn., dated March 5, says: “My colonies
are mostly very strong; they are
bringing in 5 kinds of pollen; many are
clustering in front of their hives; most
of them had large quantities of honey
left over, and I could extract an average
of 15 lbs. per colony with profit to the
bees. Bees here are given no attention
in the fall, but are left on the summer
stands, sometimes with the second story
over them, and often with only a honey-board.
Frequently there are entrances
at front and rear, and wide cracks in the
sides from which bees pour out, but disaster
never overtakes them except from
starvation.”</p>

<p>If a necessity exists for wires in foundation,
then perhaps the wired frames
are best. That but few of those in attendance
at the Northwestern Convention
“had given wired foundation a fair
trial,” was undoubtedly owing to the
fact that the great majority of those
present had never experienced the necessity
for using wires; and it might be
difficult to convince a considerable minority
of the bee-keepers in the country
that wired foundation is even desirable
for general use. Of course, for special
purposes, such as migratory bee-keeping,
shipping in summer, etc., where
not to be transferred from the frames,
wired-frames might be very desirable.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of Mr. D. A.
Jones, we are permitted to publish the
following letter. Anything relating to
the peregrinations of Mr. Benton in the
far East, and any discoveries of new
races of bees he may effect, will possess
a great attraction for our readers. His
next letter, from Singapore, will be
awaited with interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found on examination that every
queen was alive upon my arrival in
Pointe de Galle, though some of the
nuclei were greatly depopulated, owing
to the death of many bees, and would
not have lived to reach Java had I not
gotten off in Ceylon. By the next steamer
I go to Singapore. I have made
every effort to secure bees here, but
none are kept in hives in those ports I
have visited, and I do not think in any
port of the Island.</p>

<p>Of those found in trees few can be secured,
because the trees are valuable
cocoanut palms, and the entrance holes
are in the trunk of course, and are very
small. I have obtained three hives only
of the small bees, having also spent
some time fixing up the bees I brought
with me, and trying to find the large
bees, to say nothing of searching for
some place where bees could be purchased
in hives or pots. The natives
are far worse than Cypriotes to get along
with and accomplish anything. They
seem to tell lies simply for the sake of
giving an answer, where no pecuniary
gain could come to them. Again, they
seem to wish to avoid saying “I do not
know,” when the Lord knows it would
be the most appropriate thing for them
to say in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred.
The result is that it is hard work
to sift the statements made by the natives,
and Europeans&mdash;nearly all English&mdash;know
absolutely nothing of value
to us.</p>

<p>The new bees, which I think are also
found in India and many of the East
India Islands (in which case East India
bees would seem to me an appropriate
name), are real beauties. The workers
are 3/8 of an inch long, and build worker
comb 5/8 of an inch thick, 36 cells to the
square inch. The drone comb is exactly
the size, and like worker comb made by
the bees already in Europe and America.
The workers are brown with a very
ringed abdomen, the bands to the tip of
the body being broadly marked with
yellow, and thorax very fuzzy, with a
large shield between the wings; the
drones are black, inclining to a blue-black,
and are ½ of an inch long; the
queens are leather-colored, and large
compared with the workers. These bees
are very active, wonderful breeders, regular
little beauties, and can be handled
without the least smoke, scarcely ever
offering to sting. It is a pity I cannot
get more of them during my stay.</p>

<p>I am determined to find out whether
<i lang="la">Apis dorsata</i> is to be found here, if time
will permit, and if two more races I
have heard of here really do exist. I
am now where a few shillings of railway
fare will bring me to the interior of the
Island. More by next mail, with samples
of bees and comb.</p>

<p>I have had a horrible time getting
stung with large hornets while in the
jungles. It laid me up for one whole
day. These are fearful fellows, worse
than those in Cyprus.</p>

in a good cellar, and were, with a few
exceptions, weak in bees, combs in bad
order, short of stores, and badly managed
the preceding season. I united
them down to 27 before I moved them.
At the beginning of honey harvest
(basswood bloom) I doubled up to 15, so
that when the honey season opened I
had 60 first class colonies, and obtained
3,500 lbs. of summer honey. I extracted
only once. I increased by natural
swarming to 88, and at the close of the

<b>Anxious for Spring.</b>&mdash;The Monthly
was good, but a more frequent visitor,
in the shape of the Weekly, is better.
It brings fresh news, ready for use. I
spent an hour in my cellar, last evening,
examining my bees. I was heart-sick at
the condition in which I found them.
I had about 40 colonies in the fall; at
least one-half of them are dead. I have
an excellent cellar, especially for my
bees, and have not lost a colony before
for 5 or 6 years. I began to think that
losing bees in winter was an unnecessary
thing, but I see that I was mistaken,
for my bees did not lack for care
in any particular. The death of mine
is from dysentery. The small amount
of honey collected in this vicinity last
year was a very poor quality, as is seen
from the fact that it has not candied
during the winter. I extracted about
300lbs, and put it away in glass jars,
and it looks like so much New Orleans
molasses. My friend, Mr. Bischoff, had
about 40 colonies in the fall; all are now
dead but 6. They were left on their
summer stands. Mr. B. is lonesome
and wants my bees put in his apiary
next summer to keep him company, but
it remains yet to be seen if I will have
any left to keep up a humming in my
own apiary. I met Mr. Gardener, of
this city, the other day, and he reports
all of his 16 colonies dead. Several
other bee-men have told me that but
few, if any, of their bees are alive.
Winter still holds on with an iron
grasp. Our bees so much need a cleansing
flight. I am anxiously waiting for
some warm days.</p>

all the bees I had, yet I love to hear of
others' success in the bee business, and
read of others' way of management; but
I am convinced that my bees died of
some disease, the same as Mr. Carver
reported from Greencastle, Indiana, although
bees have not died so universally
throughout this country as mine
have. I have the hives and combs left,
with lots of honey in them; these I can
sell for something, perhaps, or melt
them into wax, or get a few colonies of
bees to begin anew, but it is very poor
encouragement to put much stock in
bees, the way it looks now.</p>

are dying throughout the north and
west more than usual, from short stores
and intense cold. I may say that
we have had an unprecedented cold
winter here, the thermometer at one
time ranged, for a few hours, as low as
18° above zero, but soon struggled back
to about 2&#8729;5° below. Last fall our bees
gathered a full supply of fall honey,
and none will die from cold or starve
out that are worth saving. The winter
being wet, white clover is coming out
very thick over the ground; maple, elm,
plum and wild cherry are now in bloom,
as well as heads of white clover that are
pushing out their lovely forms to the
genial sun. Bees usually work on white
clover here by the 10th of this month;
but this year our honey season will be
much later. May the “new departure”
prosper and lead us forward to perfection.</p>

<p><a name="Bees_Gone_Back_on_Him" id="Bees_Gone_Back_on_Him"></a>
<b>Gone back on him.</b>&mdash;I had 30 colonies
of bees&mdash;most of them Italians&mdash;last
fall, in Langstroth hives, packed in this
way: The ends of my hives are double-walled,
and the sides are made double
in winter by the use of division boards,
in place of 2 frames, leaving but 8
frames. I then use a crate made of
laths, which sets down around the hive
so is to leave a space of about 8 inches
for packing between it and the hive on
the sides and back end. This space I
fill with a packing of fine straw and
leaves mixed, and packed hard when
just a little damp. Then strips of board
are fitted so as to protect the top of the
straw from rain or snow; next a blanket
over the frames and 6 inches of chaff
over that, protected by the cap, in
which are openings, so as to give free
circulation of air above the chaff. The
entrance is kept open enough for a good
supply of air. In this way I have heretofore
had good success in wintering on
summer stands; but this winter it has
gone back on me. Until last Saturday,
the 5th inst., there has been no day
warm enough for bees to fly for some
months. Many did come out, even on
the coldest days, but of course could
live but a few moments out of the hive.
I let them entirely alone, except to see
that the entrances were free, until day
before yesterday, when it was warm
enough for bees to fly. I looked them
over and found only twelve of them
alive; only 4 of these are in good condition,
the others are weak and the
hives a good deal soiled. Now, what
puzzles me is this. They were all, apparently,
very nearly alike last October,
and now 4 of them are in perfect condition
while all the others were bad. Now,
why the four exceptions out of 30? I
am glad for them, but would like to understand
the reason. Can you tell us,
Mr. Editor? They have evidently not
been cold, and have had plenty of honey.
In the dead ones I have examined I find
brood in a hatching state, with half or
more of the cells empty, indicating
that young bees had hatched. I attribute
the disaster to long confinement,
but why the 4 exceptions? I say amen
to all the compliments you publish
from your subscribers for the <span class="smcap">Bee

a very good honey season here. We
have 255 colonies of bees in Langstroth
hives. Some are Italians&mdash;we like them
as honey-gatherers, but they are crosser
than our natives. We obtained 850
gals. honey, and 500 lbs. wax. The latter
we obtained from about 90 hives
which we transferred. We think apiculture
will pay here with good management.
We extracted from one colony
32 Langstroth frames well filled
with honey. Our apiary is located on a
“gum” swamp, 5 or 6 miles wide and
15 or 20 miles long, which is our main
honey source, and blooms from April
15 till May 15; we also have many other
honey producing flowers. We have a

<p>This Association held its winter meeting
at Brandon, Vt., on Jan. 20, 21, 1881.
Pres. Crane in the chair. Col. H. H.
Merritt gave an address of welcome, to
which Pres. Crane replied, stating the
object of the meeting and giving a
brief narration of the ancient history
of the honey bee, and of its improved
management in the present age.</p>

<p>Mr. A. E. Manum said success depended
on the man and circumstances.
The bee-keeper should be a person of
even temperament&mdash;not easily excited&mdash;should
be somewhat acquainted with
botany; and recommended small section
boxes, to hold not more than 2 lbs.
Everything should be kept ready and in
order. He gave an estimate of produce in
a good season with Italian bees, and
also a poor season like the past.</p>

<p>Mr. O. C. Wait, of Georgia, said that
experience had shown that bee-keeping
was no mystery or sleight of hand, but a
clear, plain, practical science. Bee-keepers
were an intelligent, enterprising
class of men; men of progress. No
intelligent man would destroy his bees.</p>

<p>After some discussion Mr. Manum exhibited
some of his honey boxes, and
explained their uses and advantages.</p>

<p>Bees were advantageous in the orchard,
and to the buckwheat crop, as he
had satisfactorily demonstrated. Some
doubts had been expressed to the value
of the red clover blossom on account of
the inability of the bee to reach the
nectary; Italians have the advantage
over black bees, because they are provided
with greater length of proboscis.</p>

<p>Pres. Crane said he had noticed bees
working in red clover early and late in
the season; bees will not work where
they get no honey.</p>

<p>In the evening, after a few preliminaries,
Mr. E. A. Hasseltine read a sensible and
witty poem on “Prospects
and Retrospects,” which was well received
by the audience.</p>

<p>The talk on Sweets, by Prof. Seely,
was a learned dissertation on the chemical
properties and qualities of the various
kinds of sweets that are offered
in our markets. He exhibited over 20
different kinds of sugar; spoke of the
various substances from which sugar
was extracted, as trees, plants, roots
and fruits; some specimens would solidify
sooner than others; sugar from cane,
corn, beets and maple, were all of the
same chemical formation.</p>

<p>J. E. Crane spoke on the Individuality
of Bees; there was a marked difference
in the character of colonies, some
were industrious, others not so; some
prefer some kinds of flowers, others reject
them; Italians dislike buckwheat,
while black bees work well on it. Every
colony has some peculiar character. He
showed several samples of honey from
different flowers, and explained their
various qualities, and also exhibited
specimens of bees from the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Dr. F. Bond said that the Creator had
placed the sweets in flowers to attract
the bee, to carry out nature's laws, by
carrying the fertilizing pollen to the unfertile
flower, and thus showing a wise
and beneficent Providence.</p>

<p>On Friday, Jan. 21, after some preliminary
business, the following were
elected officers for the ensuing year:
President, J. E. Crane; Vice-Presidents,
H. L. Leonard, E. P. Wolcott, E. A.
Hasseltine; Secretary and Treasurer,
Hon. T. Brookins.</p>

<p>Mr. O. C. Wait spoke of the bad condition
he found honey in the Boston
market, and of the manner of awarding
premiums at fairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Manum remarked that it was important
to have good queens, he advised
all to raise their own; old queens were
best to rear queens from, say 2 years old
or more; it is best to rear queens in
warm weather, when honey is plenty.</p>

<p>The question “how to prevent bees
from dwindling” Mr. Leonard answered
thus: In this case as in all other ills to
which bee-keepers are heir to, keep the
colony strong and healthy. Mr. Leonard
read an essay on “Bee-culture for
Women,” giving instances of marked
success. He said women in Vermont
were as capable and had as good facilities
as in any part of the country, and
would succeed as well, if attended to.</p>

<p>Adjourned to meet at Bristol, Vt.,
in May next.</p>

The title is perfect, and it is unincumbered, as shown
by an abstract from the Records of the county, duly
attested by the County Clerk; the taxes are all paid

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
